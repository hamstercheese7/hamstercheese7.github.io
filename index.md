Heyo, I'm Ham! I live mostly in One Piece fandom and write [a lot of fics](https://archiveofourown.org/users/hamstercheese7) about the OP Marines. They hurt me and I adore that. 

Beyond that, I absolutely love making and being a part of fandom projects and zines! Check my [Projects](/projects) page for more info on that.
